- Facilitate technology projects by community organizations.

####With government partners
- Improve government perception of civic technology, and of Code for Anchorage.
- Create a sustainable civic technology product lifecycle.

####With regional brigades
- Reduce redundancy.
- Pool efforts.

###Outreach
- Better understand the needs and habits of the community.
- Foster the adoption of useful technology within the community.
- Serve as an educational resource for the community.
- Find talented potential contributors.

###Engagement
- Retain talented contributors.
- Prevent core-team burnout.
- Increase brigade stability to improve our ability to deliver useful projects to the community.

##Strategy and Tactics
_Here is how weâ€™re going to do it:_
###Collaboration

####With community organizations
- Solicit needs and pitches from local community organizations.
- Offer common-sense tech-oriented demos or talks to interested partners.

####With government partners
- Invite our municipal sponsor and any interested members of their team to attend a meetup.
- TODO: MORE

####With regional brigades
- Collaborate on a regional project for [Code Across](http://www.codeforamerica.org/events/codeacross-2015/).

###Outreach
- Invite community organization representatives to deliver lightning talks at meetups.
- Promote a network effect with partners by boosting their work on our social and publishing platforms (and politely asking that they do the same for us).
- Investigate hosting booths at community events. (TODO: What type of events?)
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other other civic tech organizations, such as Anchorage Programming Workshop.
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other meetups and tech/design/data organizations (especially campus-based organizations).
- Invite community organizations to pitch their needs at meetups.

###Engagement
- Core team rotates responsibility for either bringing in a speaker, giving a talk, or having some other presentation.
- At Wednesday meetups, focus on collaboration: lightning talks, pitches and standups, encourage remote collaboration.
- Move Wednesday meetups back to 7:00 pm to allow people time to get off work.
- Hold monthly Second-Saturday hack days (Urban Hive?) (TODO: times? provide lunch?)
- Hold core team check-ins fifteen minutes before Wednesday meetings, and one hour core team meeetingss before hack days.
- Conduct regular surveys about satisfaction with hack nights and events
- Hold a quarterly Code for Sac open house. This event will replace that week's hack night.
- Reach out to local businesses (brewers, restaurants, etc.) about providing food sponsorship for events, because well-fed contributors are happier contributors.

## Outcomes
_Things we should be able to say at the end of 2015:_
###Collaboration

#### With community organizations
- We engaged at least two community partners.
- We delivered at least one project resulting from a collaboration with a community partner.

#### With government partners
- We regularly saw folks from our municipal sponsor at our meetups and events.
- We engaged at least one new municipal sponsor.

####With regional brigades
- We contributed to projects from other brigades.
- We adapted at least one project from another brigade for Anchorage.

###Outreach
- We engaged a group of "community beta testers" willing to provide community feedback on Code for Sacramento projects.
- We held regular instructional sessions at meetups and hack nights.
- We increased the quality, quantity, and diversity of our contributors.

###Engagement
- We improved the number of meetups attended by an average contributor.
- We increased the quality, quantity, and diversity of contributions to Code for Anchorage Github repos.
- We received more positive responses to surveys about our meetups in the fourth quarter than in the first.
- We held on to our amazing core team.
- We promoted local businesses, and they offered us their support.
