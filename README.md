##What We Want to Do This Year

###Collaboration
- Collaborate with [ANSEP](http://www.ansep.net/) (Alaska Native Science and Engineering Program)
- Further collaborate with the [Food Bank of Alaska](http://www.foodbankofalaska.org/) to explore their needs and challenges in Anchorage and in rural villages. 
- Extend our collaboration with the [Anchorage Parks Foundation](http://anchorageparkfoundation.org/) on the Trails Initiative.

- Collaborate with [Bike Anchorage](http://www.bikeanchorage.org/)
- Meet with Public Defenders, District Attornies and Court Staff to research how to use tech to improve the Anchorage and Alaska court system.

####With community organizations
- Create a group of citizen testers similar to the CUT group in Chicago and Oakland
- Better understand the needs of the community.
- Facilitate technology projects by community organizations.

####With government partners
- Improve government perception of civic technology, and of Code for Anchorage.
- Create a sustainable civic technology product lifecycle.

###Outreach
- Better understand the needs and habits of the community.
- Foster the adoption of useful technology within the community.
- Serve as an educational resource for the community.
- Find talented potential contributors.

###Engagement
- Grow the average hack night attendance to 20 by the end of the year and increase the number of people contributing to the repos (both tech and non-tech)
- Retain talented contributors.
- Prevent core-team burnout.
- Increase brigade stability to improve our ability to deliver useful projects to the community.

##Strategy and Tactics
_Here is how weâ€™re going to do it:_
###Collaboration

####With community organizations
- Solicit needs and pitches from local community organizations.
- Offer common-sense tech-oriented demos or talks to interested partners.

####With government partners
- Invite additonal people from the Muni and State to meetups, CodeAcross and NDoCH.

###Outreach
- Investigate hosting booths at community events. Especially University events.
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other other civic tech organizations, such as Anchorage Programming Workshop.
- Invite/offer speakers from/to other meetups and tech/design/data organizations (especially campus-based organizations).
- Invite community organizations to pitch their needs at meetups.

###Engagement
- Conduct regular surveys about satisfaction with hack nights and events.
- Reach out to local businesses (brewers, restaurants, etc.) about providing food sponsorship for events, because well-fed contributors are happier contributors.

###With Transit
- Create a SMS realtime bus app that we support and also use to find potential people to survey via text, notify people of additional SMS and smartphone apps.
- Work on changes to routes and times for GTFS.
- Get the Girdwood bus into GTFS (Partially done from prior hackathon)
- Research putting the UAA/Hospital shuttle information into GTFS. It is only for UAA students and employees and the Hospital employees, so how do you incorporate that.
- Research getting the Mat-Su bus into GTFS
- Connect transit to our trail information (Look into transit to trails)
- Visualziation of bus routes and times
- Stretch goal - Realtime Transit API

###With DHSS and Foodbank of Alaska
- Spread the word on Balance and have 250 unique users by the end of the year (31 currently)
- Translate Balance into 2 additional languages based on research.
- Create a SNAP screener
- Research a Medicaid screener for expansion on 7/1 in Alaska
- Onboard for AK SNAP and research ways to improve this process.
- Help citizens find SNAP locations.
- Research TANF and ATM fees.
- Screening locator for diseases (Further research required)

###With data and app infrastructure
- Research and create an accessible property tax dataset based on CfA work
- Research Geo-coding solution for Anchorage and AK
- Research and create a system for mapping address and name data across gov datasets.
- Provide a text based look up that lets you text an address get a lat and long that can be queried against geo databases. So that any finda type app can be accessed via SMS as well.
- Create a group of civic translators for making apps available in multiple languages.
- Curate and organize available gov data sources.
- Show examples of existing Gov GIS datasets so people can easily see what type of data is in a geo dataset.
- Work with gov and other agencies to get more data discovered and accessible. 

###With sponsors
- Provide links that make it easy to dontate to CfA earmarked for Code for Anchorage via web and mobile.
- Find additional yearly sponsors as well as event sponsors to help fund and increase our overall budget. Money spent in the first part of the year should also focus on increasing our sponsors for the second part of the year.
